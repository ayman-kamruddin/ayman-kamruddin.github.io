    <h1>Why Nations Fail - Book Review</h1>
    <p>
        The authors try to explain why some countries are poor and fail, while others are rich and succeed. Their answer: democratic, inclusive political institutions make the difference. While this seems like a noble response, and there certainly is truth to this, this response is buried in the hypocrisy of hiding ugly wars that have been waged to gain and maintain their global position, alongside the delusion that they have superior institutions. The US is doing better than Mexico (the bookâ€™s opening example) not just because of their difference in political institutions, but rather also because the US was founded by colonial killers themselves - while Mexico was founded on plundered and destroyed ruins, courtesy of the Spanish. This book adds to neo-imperial literature attempting to explain politics while ignoring bloody foreign policy past and present.
